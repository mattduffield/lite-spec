# Highlighters

In order for us to add the Sublime Syntax, we need to ensure that the file is added to the following directory:

```bash
/Users/matthewduffield/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages/User/LiteSpec/LiteSpec.sublime-syntax
```

Notice, that the above reference expects there to be a folder for the syntax definition.
